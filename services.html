Not only did he produce the exact look and feel we were after but they also incorporated cutting edge ideas which enhance the effectiveness of the site, including a new logo & brand identity.

									<p>We approached Fuel Design to redesign our existing website, designed and built for us by Fuel Design 7 years ago. Not only did the Fuel Design team produce the exact look and feel we were after but they also incorporated cutting edge ideas which enhance the effectiveness of the site, including a new logo & brand identity. Jason and the team were able to handle any request we had and took the time to explain technical procedures in a way that we could understand and implement.</p>

								<div class="item">
									<p>Selecting Fuel Design from a short list of highly acclaimed web developers was easily the best decision of 2013 for our company. Jason has assembled a tight team of extremely talented individuals, all passionate about their work and it showed right from the initial presentation through to the finished product. Fuelled by a desire to be the best, every challenge was met with a solution even if it was outside the brief and beyond what could be expected. This exciting young company will continue to partner our business and keep us ahead of the competition in this generation of online marketing.</p>

Sales kicked off immediately. Thank you Stephen for your 'can do' approach and for implementing new industry standards in functionality. Choosing Fuel Design was the right decision. Thank you from the team at Wixii!</p>
